Laravel E-Commerce API Project

This Laravel project provides a well-structured e-commerce API with functionalities for managing stores, categories, products, orders, customers, and webhook integration with converted.in and Pixel client SDK.

Features:

RESTful API: Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for stores, categories, products, orders, and customers.
Eloquent ORM: Leverages Laravel's Eloquent ORM for efficient database interactions and model relationships.
Authentication (Optional): Consider implementing user authentication (e.g., JWT) if your API requires authorization for specific actions.
Webhook Integration with converted.in: Uses observers and the converted.in Laravel SDK to send relevant data to converted.in for conversion tracking upon order creation, update, or deletion.
Pixel Client SDK Integration: Employs observers and the Pixel client Laravel SDK to send data to Facebook Pixel for conversion tracking and audience building.
Security: Follows Laravel's security best practices to protect your API from vulnerabilities (refer to Laravel documentation for specific guidance).
Testing: Encourages unit and integration testing to ensure code quality and maintainability.

API Endpoints: Refer to the routes/api.php file for the defined API routes. Each model will typically have CRUD endpoints (e.g., /api/stores, /api/stores/{id}). Consult Laravel documentation for standard API request and response formats (RESTful).

Webhooks:

Observer Events: Webhooks are triggered on specific model events (e.g., OrderCreated).
converted.in Integration: Refer to converted.in's API documentation and the SDK for guidance on building data structures and making API calls within observer methods.
Pixel Client SDK Integration: Consult the Pixel client SDK documentation for instructions on sending data to Facebook Pixel based on your desired tracking events.
Testing:

Unit and Integration Testing: Implement unit and integration tests using Laravel's built-in testing framework or a preferred testing library.
Test Coverage: Strive for high test coverage to ensure code functionality and resilience.
Further Development:

Authorization: Consider implementing user authentication (e.g., JWT) based on your project's requirements.
Error Handling: Define a robust API error handling strategy using Laravel's exception handling features.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using tools like Swagger) to aid developers in understanding endpoint usage.
Deployment: Refer to Laravel documentation for deployment instructions and best practices (e.g., using Forge, a cloud platform).
